NEW WEAPON
新武器
1) Ordinary weapon. Can be purchased from merchants, as well as found in submarine wrecks.
1) 传统武器。可以从商人那里购买，也可以在潜艇残骸中找到。

1.	Semi-Auto Shotgun - Holds 4 rounds. Shoots faster than a autoshotgun. After each shot, durability is reduced by 25%; gradually restored by every 25% 2 seconds after the shooting stops.
1. 半自动霰弹枪 - 可装4发子弹。射速比自动霰弹枪快。每次射击后，耐久度降低25%；射击停止后2秒内逐渐恢复，每次恢复25%。

2.	Winchester - holds 4 special bullets. bullets can be ordinary, physicorium and with depleted fuel (unlike other bullets of this type does not require a talent). Has a slow reload after firing. Regular ammo has twice the damage of a revolver, the other two types have slightly more damage + increased armor penetration.
2. 温彻斯特--可容纳4颗特殊的子弹。子弹可以是普通、刚素和贫化燃料（与其他这种类型的子弹不同，不需要天赋）。开枪后有一个缓慢的重新装填。普通子弹的伤害是左轮手枪的两倍，其他两种类型的子弹伤害略高并且有一定的穿甲能力。

3.	Autopistol - holds one special magazine for 24 shots. The total damage from the entire magazine is comparable to six shots from a revolver. Skills that affect the damage of a revolver also affect this weapon. Unlike a revolver, a higher quality directly increases the damage, and not the repulsion and stun power.
3. 自动手枪--可容纳一个装有24发子弹的特殊弹夹。整个弹夹的总伤害与左轮手枪的六发子弹相当。影响左轮手枪伤害的技能也影响这种武器。与左轮手枪不同的是，更高的品质直接增加了伤害，而不是击退和眩晕能力。

4.	Compact grenade launcher - holds 4 grenade. Fits only in the right hand. Can be carried in inventory. Long reload time after firing. Has a chance to explode when fired, briefly stunning the shooter and inflicting minor burns. Has no quality levels.

5.	Drum SMG - holds 128 special rounds. Deals high damage to unarmored targets, but almost no damage to armored ones and isnt able to break through protective plates. Quality levels increase damage by 5% instead of 10%.

6.	ITD-284 - grenade. After the throw, it activates after three seconds (when used in a detonator, activation is instantaneous). When activated creates a zone around itself, in which creatures are greatly slowed down and become twice as vulnerable to any damage. The received damage values will be saved even after deactivating the device or leaving the area of effect. Can't be crafted.

7.	IG-16 - grenade. After the throw, it activates after three seconds (when used in a detonator, activation is instantaneous). When activated, it spawns explosions around itself for ten seconds. Can't be crafted.

2) “Secret” weapon - crafted from a hacked terminal, which is bought from a man in a hood for 5,000 credits.

1.	Deepgun - holds small and large boxes of minigun ammo. Small ones have an advantage over large ones in that they stack up to three and in total give more shots than large ones, but they are more expensive to craft. Has a flashlight that requires a battery to operate.
It has the ability to fold up, in which it can be carried in the inventory, but requires manual extraction of ammunition and battery from it, otherwise they will be lost forever.
It has three types of ammunition - regular, physicorium and dementonite.
Physicorium deals more damage but less bleeding.
Dementonite has increased armor penetration but deals less damage.


2.	Arzi - contains an alien power unit. Deals damage similar to an alien pistol, but has a much higher rate of fire and consumes the charge of the power unit much more economically. When the power unit is connected, a lantern is turned on, which works indefinitely.

3.	Glick - contains special fuel cylinders. In fact, it is a portable death - it deals massive damage on a direct hit with fire and soft tissue damage, penetrating 80% of armor. Slows down the wearer. Fuel tanks quickly lose durability when on fire and explode, dealing massive damage to structures and characters.

4.	Railgun - holds 2 special projectiles. Can be worn on the back. When carried in the hands, the arrow slows down, when worn on the back - it doesnt. After each shot there is a long reload.
Two types of ammunition - physicorium and dementonite. Physicoriums do a lot of direct damage, Dementonites do less damage, but pierce through one obstacle and also deal a lot of damage if they hit directly into the body.


5.	BFG - contains one special energy cell. Can be worn on the back. Long charge before firing. Penetrates all structures and characters through, inflicting fatal damage. With the right shot, it can instantly kill Charybdis and Endworm. The power cell is enough for one shot.

6.	Crazer - contains fragments of red crystals. Carries in inventory. Fires a continuous laser beam that penetrates any structure and causes abnormal bleeding in all affected characters. For some unknown reason, the beam does not hit those outside the sub if the shooter is inside it.

7.	Plasmoid - melee weapon. Holds a battery. In normal mode, on impact, inflicts a small blunt injury. In activated mode, it illuminates everything around in a small radius and deals high burn damage on impact. The activated mode requires a battery.
(non-descriptive note - I haven't checked to see if skills that increase melee damage affect this weapon, so the final result may be as unbalanced as possible)


2.5) Secret-secret weapon - obtained by exchanging sealed boxes from a man in a hood, with an additional payment of 15,000 credits

They are five variations of an endless laser weapon that deals fire and ragged damage. After a certain number of shots, it goes to reload. Reloads much faster if you don't use up all your shots. Each weapon has a random trade chance, so you probably won't be able to unlock them all in one playthrough.

3) Noseless weapons - blue clowns that can be found on new missions of abandoned outposts.

1.	Clown Ammo - Common Revolver, SMG, and Shotgun ammo that creates confetti on impact. They deal more damage.

2.	Toy hammer (with stakes) - deals small ragged damage, used with one hand. Has a small chance to infect with any vanilla poison except paralysis.

3.	Toy Hammer - Deals moderate blunt damage, long stun and cooldown after hitting. Has a moderate chance to infect with Deliriumine and an additional affect that enhances psychosis.

4.	Psionic Pistol - Infinite. Long reload after one shot. Briefly stuns the target and deals psionic damage to them (new affect). Has a huge spread when the skill of medicine is less than 60. Deals psionic damage to the owner if he is not wearing a Noseless costume or a Noseless mask.

5.	Psionic Rifle - Infinite. It has a small number of shots, after which it goes into a long reload - reloads faster if you do not use up all the shots. Deals psionic damage that breaks all defenses. Has a huge spread when the skill of medicine is less than 75. Deals psionic damage to the owner if he is not wearing a Noseless costume or a Noseless mask.

4) Pirate weapons - get from new pirate missions

1.	Pirate Deepgun - holds small sets of minigun ammunition. Can be carried in inventory. It has a slower rate of fire and greater spread than the original deepgun.

2.	Pirate Arzi - Has its own resource of ammunition. Has increased damage, greater armor penetration and can be carried on the back. When the entire resource of ammunition is used up, it becomes useless. Weapons that can be found with pirates cannot be used, they can only be found in the lockers of pirate submarines.

3.	Broken laser weapons - Similar to the pirate Arzi, it has its own ammo resource. When it is completely used up, it breaks, stunning the arrow and causing a short overload of electrical panels.

4.	Pirate rapid Fissile Accelerator - Shoots without charging because bots can't understand the concept of "gradually charging weapons" at the moment. Cannot be used by players.

5.	The Pirate Revolver - a recolored regular revolver.

6.	The Pirate Autopistol - a recolored regular autopistol.

7.	Pirate winchester - holds only one bullet. Has internal storage for 10 bullets. Quality levels add 15% stats instead of 10%.

8.	Pirate SMG - an ordinary submachine gun. Consumes half as much ammo when firing, but has slightly increased spread and weapon skill requirements.

9.	Crowbaxe - A melee weapon. Deals less damage than a boarding ax and has a longer cooldown after swinging, but is capable of breaking doors with a slightly lower speed than a conventional crowbar.


NEW CHARACTERS

The red jelly preparation reduces bleeding by 60% (this and subsequent numbers go from the maximum buff), blue - protection from burns by 60%, green - protection from stun by 60%. They have enhanced options that can only be obtained by crafting. Empowered variants grant 75% damage resistance, and have that maximum until the duration expires.
