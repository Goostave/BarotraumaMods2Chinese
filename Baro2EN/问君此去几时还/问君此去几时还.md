模组简介：
T.S.M MISSION

世道这幅模样，几乎无人可信，魑魅魍魉跋扈自恣，人类尔虞我诈勾心斗角。但还好你能来到奇迹之海，我们的航道布满尸骸，木卫二的深渊尽是未知。但我们的未来并不止步于此，诸位船长，开起我们的钢铁巨兽，拿起我们的钢枪，去战斗吧。我们甘为这日月山河，倾尽生命。但还好你能来到奇迹之海，我们的航道布满尸骸，木卫二的深渊尽是未知。但我们的未来并不止步于此，诸位船长，开起我们的钢铁巨兽，拿起我们的钢枪，去战斗吧。我们甘为这日月山河，倾尽生命。
Look at this world, monsters from your deepest naightmare domineering themselves, while human beings never stops cheating and fighting with their own kind. Luckily we have you here with the Sea of Miracle (T.S.M), though our path is strewn with corpses, and Europa's abyss is full of unknown. Yet our future does not stop here, captain, steer your steel beasts, pick up your steel guns, go to fight. We are willing to give our lives for our families, for comrades, and for the civilization of humanity.
